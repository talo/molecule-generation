  # openbabel from conda + python bindings (separate) needed for plip
  - openbabel
  - pip:
    - numpy
    # this won't work cuz openbabel is a wonderful piece of software
    # - openbabel
    # but this works!
    - pybel
    # this also wont work as it will check for pip-installed openbabel
    # instead, clone the plip repo from github, go to setup.py & comment out openbabel under install_requires,
    # then do python3 setup.py install, this will work as long as you already have openbabel working via a separate method (not pip)
